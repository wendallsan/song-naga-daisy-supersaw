## Features

- **Supersaw Oscillator** modelled on the Roland JP-8000  
- **DRIFT** and **SHIFT** knobs adjust supersaw detune and amount of effect
- **Suboscillator** that can be mixed in with the main main signal via the **GROWL** knob.  Waveform and octave can be selected while in ALT MODE by adjusting the **GROWL** knob.    
- **LOW PASS FILTER** can be controlled by the **HOWL** section, including Frequency Control via the **HOWL** knob, resonance via the "R" knob, and drive with the "D" knob.  
- **COMB FILTER** can be controlled by the **HOWL** section, including Frequency via the **HOWL** knob and Decay Time via the "R" knob.  
- **FILTER MODE** can be set by adjusting the **HOWL** knob while in ALT MODE.  
- **FANGS** section controls the amp envelope.  Fangs Mod amount sets the envelope's effect on the amp, and is set by adjusting the FANGS "A" knob in ALT MODE.  
- **POUNCE** section controls a routable envelope, which can modulate **DRIFT**, **SHIFT** and **HOWL**.  
- **SLITHER** section provides a routable LFO, which can modulate **DRIFT,** **SHIFT,** **HOWL**, or **CLAWS**.  LFO rate is set via the **SLITHER** knob and LFO Waveform can be set via the **SLITHER** knob while in ALT MODE.  
- **Full MIDI Control** of all parameters via USB-over-MIDI input.  USB also powers the instrument.  
- **4 Note Polyphony**  
- **Stereo Output**  

### About the Supersaw Oscillator  
The Supersaw Oscillator used in **Takshaka** is based on the thesis ["How to Emulate the Super Saw"](https://forum.orthogonaldevices.com/uploads/short-url/rLjREzRcZvvK2527rFnTGvuwY1b.pdf) written by Adam Szabo in 2010.
